    ],
    "reasoning": "The overall market sentiment is bearish due to several negative factors. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, popular meme coins, have experienced significant losses, indicating a lack of confidence in these assets. David Sacks' revelation of a $16 billion bitcoin misstep highlights potential mismanagement and loss in the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, a prominent crypto analyst's forecast of a major Bitcoin correction further adds to the negative sentiment. The decline in whale holdings and increased market uncertainty suggest a cautious approach from larger investors, potentially leading to a broader market sell-off. These factors collectively contribute to a bearish outlook for the cryptocurrency market in the near term."
